# Mapping Earthquakes
#Overview
The objective for this project was to gather earthquake data from USGS API, create maps with 3 different layers as well as  different map types. The map presents earthquakes locations and size, earthquakes greater than 4.5, as well as tectonic plates. 

#Resources
Data sources used:
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson,
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson,
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json

#Results
As seen below with all layers active it can be a little confusing, but with the ability to turn on and off each one. You are able to better understand the information presented and even present it in a clearer way.

When compared to the next image, you are able to see just the earthquakes that are greater than 4.5 in magnitude.

With dark mode active you can focus more on just the information being presented with out having geographic colors to look at.

If you turn on streets view you are able to then tell where the earthquakes are occurring.
